# Internet

## How does the internet work?

The internet works through a global network of innterconnected computers
and servers, communicating via standardized protocals, Data is broken into
packets and routed through various nodes using the internet Protocol(IP)
These packets travel across different physical infrastructures, including fiber optic
cables, satellites, annd wireless networks, The Transmission Control Protocol(TCP) ensures
reliable delivery and reassembly of packets at their destination, Domain Name Syytem(DNS)
servers tranlate human-readble website names into IP addresses, when you access
a website, your device sends a request to the appropriate server, which responds withe the
requeted data, This process, facilitated by routers, switches, and other networking
equipment, enables the seamless exchange of information accross vast distances,
forming the backbone of our digital communnications.

## What is HTTP?

HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communincation onn the Wolrd Wide Web,
Its an application-layer protocol that defines how messages are formmatted and transmitted
betweenn web browsers and servers, HTTP operates on a request-response model, Clients
(usually web browsers) send requests to servers, which then respond with the requested data,
The protocol is stateless, meaning each request is independent of any previous request,
HTTP supports various methods (GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,ect) for different types of interations
with resources, HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, using encrption to protect data in transit.
HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 are more recent versionns, offering improved performance through features like
multiplexing and header compression, Understanding HTTP is crucial for web development, as it underpins
how web applications are communicate and function.
