# Internet

## How does the internet work?

The internet works through a global network of innterconnected computers
and servers, communicating via standardized protocals, Data is broken into
packets and routed through various nodes using the internet Protocol(IP)
These packets travel across different physical infrastructures, including fiber optic
cables, satellites, annd wireless networks, The Transmission Control Protocol(TCP) ensures
reliable delivery and reassembly of packets at their destination, Domain Name Syytem(DNS)
servers tranlate human-readble website names into IP addresses, when you access
a website, your device sends a request to the appropriate server, which responds withe the
requeted data, This process, facilitated by routers, switches, and other networking
equipment, enables the seamless exchange of information accross vast distances,
forming the backbone of our digital communnications.

## What is HTTP?

HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communincation onn the Wolrd Wide Web,
Its an application-layer protocol that defines how messages are formmatted and transmitted
betweenn web browsers and servers, HTTP operates on a request-response model, Clients
(usually web browsers) send requests to servers, which then respond with the requested data,
The protocol is stateless, meaning each request is independent of any previous request,
HTTP supports various methods (GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,ect) for different types of interations
with resources, HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, using encrption to protect data in transit.
HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 are more recent versionns, offering improved performance through features like
multiplexing and header compression, Understanding HTTP is crucial for web development, as it underpins
how web applications are communicate and function.

## What is Domain Name?

A domain name is a human-readable address used to identify and access websites on the internet.
it servces as a more memorable alternative to the numerical IP addresses that computers use
to locate web servers, Domain names consist of two main parts: the second-level domain
(usually the website or organazation name) and the top-level domain(such as, .com, .org,.net)
They are registers throuth domain regsiters and must be unique within their top-level domainn
Domain names are crucial for branding, marketing, and establishing an online presence.
The Domain Name System(DNS) translates domain names into IP addresses, allowing users to
access websites by typing in familiar names rather than complex number sequences, Domain names
can be customized, transferred, and renewed, playing a vital role in the stucture and accessiblity
of the World Wide Web

## Hosting

Web hosting is a service that allows individuals and organizations to make their websites accessible on the internet. It involves storing website files on powerful computers called servers, which are connected to a high-speed network. When users enter a domain name in their browser, the web host serves the website’s content. Hosting services range from shared hosting (where multiple websites share server resources) to dedicated hosting (where a server is exclusively used by one client). Other types include VPS (Virtual Private Server) hosting, cloud hosting, and managed WordPress hosting. Web hosts typically provide additional services such as email hosting, domain registration, SSL certificates, and technical support. The choice of web hosting impacts a website’s performance, security, and scalability, making it a crucial decision for any online presence.

## DNS

DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical, decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) that computers use to identify each other. DNS servers distributed worldwide work together to resolve these queries, forming a global directory service. The system uses a tree-like structure with root servers at the top, followed by top-level domain servers (.com, .org, etc.), authoritative name servers for specific domains, and local DNS servers. DNS is crucial for the functioning of the Internet, enabling users to access websites and services using memorable names instead of numerical IP addresses.
